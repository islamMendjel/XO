# X_O
This project is a simple implementation of the classic X-O (Tic-Tac-Toe) game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (X or O) until one player achieves three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or until the grid is filled with no winner, resulting in a draw.

Key Features:

    Provides a user-friendly interface for playing the X-O game directly in the web browser.
    Utilizes HTML for structuring the game board and user interface elements.
    Applies CSS for styling the game interface, including grid layout, symbols, and player prompts.
    Implements JavaScript for game logic, including handling player turns, checking for a winner, and detecting a draw condition.
    Supports responsive design for compatibility with various screen sizes and devices.

Usage:

    Open the provided HTML file in a web browser.
    Two players take turns clicking on the empty cells of the grid to place their respective symbols (X or O).
    The game automatically checks for a winner after each move and displays the result.
    If no winner is found and the grid is filled with symbols, the game announces a draw.
